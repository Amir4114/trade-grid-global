---

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-07-18

Target tag: **`v0.4.0-purchase-orders`**.  
npm version: `0.4.0`

### Added

- Migration `017_purchase_order_system.sql`: `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_items`, `purchase_order_events`, `purchase_order_documents`, private bucket `purchase-order-docs`
- RPCs: `create_purchase_order_draft`, `update_purchase_order_draft`, `issue_purchase_order`, `accept_purchase_order`, `reject_purchase_order`, `cancel_purchase_order`, `get_purchase_order`, `list_purchase_orders`
- Extended `revoke_award` (additive replace): blocks revoke when issued/accepted PO exists; auto-cancels draft POs
- Service layer `lib/purchase-orders/*`
- Buyer Orders UI (replaces mock): list, create from award, detail, issue/cancel
- Supplier Orders UI: list, accept/reject, timeline
- Notifications: `purchase_order.created|issued|accepted|rejected|cancelled` (`purchase_order.completed` reserved, not emitted in 3.1)
- Script: `scripts/verify-purchase-order-system.mjs`
- Phase 0 locks in `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` (AD-3.1-*)

### Changed

- Procurement path now: RFQ → Quotation → Award → Purchase Order (issue/accept)
- Mock buyer Orders page removed

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-07-18

Also tagged as **`v0.3.0-procurement-complete`**.  
Commit: `7cd98e1` — *Complete procurement workflow with supplier award system*  
npm version: `0.3.0`

### Added

- Enterprise documentation structure under `docs/` (architecture, planning, deployment)
- Migration `016_award_system.sql`: `quotation_awards`, `award_events`
- RPCs: `award_supplier`, `get_award`, `revoke_award`
- Buyer compare & award UI on RFQ detail
- Supplier win/lose messaging and `/dashboard/supplier/awards`
- Notifications: `quotation.awarded`, `quotation.not_selected`, `rfq.awarded`
- Script: `scripts/verify-award-system.mjs`
- Extended `supplier_can_access_rfq` for post-award participant read access
- Enterprise documentation tree under `docs/`

### Changed

- RFQ award locks quoting (`status = awarded`); losing offers marked `not_selected`
- Architecture documentation promoted to `v0.3.0-procurement-complete`

### Security

- Award mutations via SECURITY DEFINER RPC only; RLS SELECT for buyer/supplier/admin scopes
- Losing suppliers receive award existence without peer commercial award payload via `get_award`

## [v0.2] — 2026-07-15 … 2026-07-17

Grouped trust-ops + RFQ + quotation era (commits `e215df3`, `ee783d7` and related 011–015 work).

- Admin Verification Command Center + product management surfaces

- Company verification submission restricted to trusted RPC path

### Security

- Notifications: no client INSERT; SELECT own rows only
- Company `verification_status` self-assignment blocked for non-admins
- Quotation draft privacy from buyers; cross-company thread isolation

---
