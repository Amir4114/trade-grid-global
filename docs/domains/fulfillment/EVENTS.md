# Fulfillment Events

Fulfillment events are append-only audit facts. They are distinct from inbox notifications, even when both use the same type string.

## Event catalog

| Event                             | Meaning                                               | Typical state effect                 |

## Event record contract

Each event records:

- Fulfillment identifier.
- Stable event type.
- Actor type and actor user when applicable.
- Prior and resulting status when applicable.
- Human-readable message.
- Structured, non-sensitive metadata.
- UTC creation time.

Milestone events additionally carry `milestone_type` and UTC `occurred_at` metadata. The aggregate read orders events by operational occurrence time, then append time and event ID for deterministic chronology. Status-derived milestones continue to use their existing event names.

Events are inserted through `_append_fulfillment_event`; update/delete is blocked. Corrections use a compensating future event, never history rewriting.

## Notifications

Trusted RPCs use `_create_system_notification` for relevant counterpart updates. Current notification emission includes lifecycle milestones such as opened, production/QC changes, ready-to-ship, shipped/transit, delivered/completed, cancellation, failure, and dispute.

Notification rules:

1. Clients never insert notification rows.
2. Recipient is derived from trusted party identity.
3. `entity_type` is `fulfillment_order`; `entity_id` is the Fulfillment ID.
4. Action URLs must use the application safe-URL policy.
5. A notification is delivery UX; the event row remains the audit fact.

Some lifecycle fact and notification names intentionally differ: packaging stores `fulfillment.packed` while notifying `fulfillment.ready_to_ship`; QC rework stores `fulfillment.qc_rework` while the notification uses `fulfillment.qc_failed`. Production resume is event-only. Phase B milestone/comment notifications use matching event type strings and deep-link into the Fulfillment segment.

## Consumers

- Fulfillment detail timeline.
- Buyer and supplier notifications.
- Support/admin read-only investigation.
- Future Analytics cycle-time and exception models.
- Future Logistics/Claims integrations and AI anomaly indicators.

No external event bus is implemented. Any future publication must define delivery, ordering, idempotency, privacy, and schema versioning without changing stored event meanings.
